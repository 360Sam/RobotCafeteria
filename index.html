							<h1>Robot Cafeteria!</h1>
							<p>The future is now! Your school has purchased a new robot to run the cafeteria. 
							Robots don't need paychecks, never take sick days, and the school will save a fortune on hairnets. 
							But the robot needs to be programmed, and the Assistant Principal has forgotten everything he learned about math! 
							He's asked you to help program the robot for Pizza Day. When you're done, he'd like a brief report explaining your 
							results and how well they work.</p>
							<ul>You will need to:
								<li>look at the situation carefully to understand the problem</li>
								<li>figure out how to program the robot with function rules</li>
								<li>test the functions to make sure they work</li>
								<li>write a short report explaining your result.</li>
							</ul>
							<h3>Understand the Situation</h3>
							<p>Every Pizza Day, the Assistant Principal will type information into the robot. Look at the "Inputs" box to see what 
							information the robot is given (and the variables it uses to store that information). The Assistant Principal has already put 
							today's numbers there. But you can change them to test your formulas 
							and make sure they give good answers no matter what the inputs are.</p>
							<p>The robot is designed to give some information back to the user. See what information it returns in the "Outputs" box (and the 
							variables it uses when calculating the answers). The 
							robot uses function rules to calculate the numbers it returns by using the information it is given. The assistant principal programed
								some formulas, but he can see that the robot isn't outputing correct information. Fortunately, the robot also comes with a manual to help writing new formulas.</p>
							<p>The Assistant Principal doesn't know how the formulas should work. But he has given you three important directions:</p>
							<ul><li>Make sure the robot orders enough pizza for all the students.</li>
							<li>Make sure the robot doesn't try to order fractions of a pizza. It can only order whole numbers of pizzas.</li>
							<li>Try not to order more pizza than necessary.</li>
							</ul>
							<h3>Directions</h3>
	
							<p>Look at how the assistant principal's formulas are written, but notice that they don't give correct outputs. Experiment to learn how the robot works and try to write formulas to solve the problem as best as possible. When you're done programming 
							the robot, write (on paper) an explanation of what you did for the Assistant Principal to study later. Make sure to include what formulas you 
							wrote and what answers they give for the current inputs. Then explain your mathematical thinking about how your formulas work and how well 
							they meet the Assistant Principal's requirements.</p>
